I have requirement, that might be complicated. I have set of git repos with folder structure repo/<l1>/<l2>. I need a python script to which i will this path as the parameterscript should walk through the folder structure repo/<l1>/<l2> recursively... no deeper than l2. Check if it a git repo. If so should show me the current status of the files pending for commit. Ask the question do I want to commit? If yes, take one line of commit comments from terminal, add all content and commit. If no, skip and continue.If the repo is commited, then it should check if it is pushed by checking how behind it is from head and display the message. Ask should it push. If answer is yes (push to remote) if not skipAll the interaction should be verbose on terminal and also to be written to log file ./logs/log_<timestamp>.log
